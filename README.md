# CBox-FE
Project Description: 
CBox is a cloud-based service for storing, editing and sharing text documents. The goal of the project is to provide users with a secure and convenient platform for working with text files, accessible from anywhere in the world. The CBox service allows users to upload, edit and share documents with other users in real time, making it useful for both individual use and teamwork. The project has the advantage of a simple and intuitive interface, as well as robust data protection. Users can work with documents on different devices, providing flexibility and convenient workflows. CBox is aimed at both corporate clients and private users who need to efficiently manage their documents in the cloud. 
Key features: 
- User registration and authorization. 
- Uploading text documents to the cloud. 
- Real-time editing of documents. 
- Collaborative editing with other users.

Basic users: 
Guest - can register for full access. Registered user - has access to all system functions, including uploading, editing and sharing documents. Administrator - manages users of the system, monitors its operation and provides security.
To implement the CBox project we use:
Figma: for design development.
React.js: used to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
HTML5 and CSS3: the foundation of web page structure and style.
JavaScript (ES6+): for writing frontend logic and working with APIs.
Bootstrap - CSS framework for responsive and adaptive design.

Instructions for organizing network interaction:

We use a local network if we can meet in person and use hamachi otherwise. To send requests and connect the backend and frontend, we use the axios library, swagger and use ready-made functions and methods.
